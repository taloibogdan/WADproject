Photohelp [Temporary Name] is a web platform designed for lovers of image editing and photography.

Imagine you take a photo with your friends in Rome, in front of the Colosseum. Later, you realize that behind you were some people you did not want in the photo. Unfortunately, you do not have the photoshop skills you would need to edit the image.

The solution is simple: you (the normal user) will upload the photo to our website and ask for help. Afterwards, designer users will be able to download the image, make the requested edit and re-upload it to the site. The owner of the photo will then be able to rate the designer's work.

The requests can either be free, have a set price (the price the user is willing to pay) or can be bid on by designers.
